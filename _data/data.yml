        tagline: "
         Transfer Learning Library (Translearners) is an open-source and well-documented library
          for Domain Adaptation, Task Adaptation, and Domain Generalization.
         It is based on pure PyTorch with high performance and friendly API.
         The code is pythonic, and the design is consistent with torchvision.
         You can easily develop new algorithms, or readily apply existing algorithms."
