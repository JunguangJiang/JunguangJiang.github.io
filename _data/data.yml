    summary: |
      I am Junguang Jiang. Now, I'm a Master Student at Tsinghua University under the supervision of Mingsheng Long.

      My current research foucs on algorithms and real-world applications for deep learning, transfer learning and domain adaptation.

      I created a Transfer Learning Library
      <a href="https://github.com/thuml/Transfer-Learning-Library">TLlib</a>
      and got over <img alt="GitHub stars" src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/thuml/Transfer-Learning-Library?style=social">.
